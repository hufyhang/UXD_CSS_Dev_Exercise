## Intro

This repo contains my anwsers to all the open ended questions and implementions of the three practical exercises.

Please kindly notice that, since the PSD provided in exercise PDF is unable to be downloaded from Dropbox in China (not sure if it is due to China's firewall restriction), the styles and values (i.e. spacing, color, dimension) used below are only based on what I can read and interpret from the text description and the provided screenshot of this very exercise. I am sorry about any possible inconvenience for this.

The "Dropbox Download Error" is the screenshot which shows the encountered error when I tried to download the PSD from Dropbox.
